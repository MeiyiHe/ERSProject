To compensate the design capability gap, we pursue design based equivalent scaling, that is, to rely on design technology improvement to achieve performance, power, area and cost tradeoffs to rescue Moore s law scaling of value.


When distance increases, the coupling cap will decrease. Thus, the voltage change due to crosstalk on this segment will increase, which leads to increased delay uncertainty.


As is evident, the manual approach is quick and easy and can be used for pathfinding when technology libraries are unavailable; however, fine grained implementation details such as routed wire length and area, and power of setup buffers, etcetera.


The second work in thrust one predicts three D I C benefit from two D I C implementations and has been presented at DAC two thousand fifteen.


To predict Pareto frontiers from few, I E, less than twenty placements, we develop an algorithm to interpolate and extrapolate parameter values.


Our future works include application of our methods to traces from real server workloads, expanding our methods to handle other objectives, and achieving solutions that are temperature history aware.


In the last step of our optimization, we perform a matching optimization between available white spaces and gating logics, and insert gating logics as E C O steps.

This slide compares our clustering solution which understands flop tray shapes versus a solution of the traditional K means clustering which treats each flop tray as a point.


After each max flow optimization, if the currents between two partitions are not balanced, we cluster the nodes from the smaller partition, together with a neighbor node, into one super vertex.
