    "Self aligned multiple patterning is the leading option in the sub fourteen nanometer  node.  And, the final patterns are determined by the cut process. The leftmost cartoon shows the original layout, where blue rectangles are wire segments. In this process, one dimensional or one Dee wires are patterned first. Then, the wires are cut by red colored cut shapes. So, the final layout is totally different from the original layout. There are Ee  Oh  El extensions and dummy fills. This will affect timing and performance."
