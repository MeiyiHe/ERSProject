Recall that we perform iterative local moves to minimize skew variation.
We use three types of local moves.
We use three types of local moves to minimize variation.
Recall that we minimize skew variation.
First, we displace the target buffer in eight directions and size the buffer.
Second, we displace eight moves to size the three types of buffer.
Three target moves minimize local variation.
